# computer-vision-game
Repository dedicated to the development of a game using computer vision and image processing.

## Requirements
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/) 

- *pygame*
```bash
pip install pygame
```

- *numpy*
```bash
pip install numpy
```

- *OpenCV*
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SalesRyan/computer-vision-game.git
```

## Implementation

### [haarcascades](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades)

Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
